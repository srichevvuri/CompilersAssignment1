Project Description: Data Processing Project

Objective: The objective of this project is to develop a
data processing application that reads data from an input
file, processes the data, removes excess space and
comments from the code, tokenizes the remaining code,
and prints the output in a tabular form.

To-Dos:
1. Write code in the language of your choice to read
data from an input file.
2. Process the data to remove excess space and
comments from the code.
3. Tokenize the remaining code.
4. Print the code after removing excess space and
comments.
5. Tokenize the remaining code and print output in
tabular form.
